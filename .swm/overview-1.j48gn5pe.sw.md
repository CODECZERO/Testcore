Overview of Testcore&nbsp;

Testcore is a digital solution designed to replicate and enhance the traditional offline exam conduction process, transforming it into an efficient and scalable online system. It addresses critical challenges such as resource wastage, logistical complexities, and time inefficiencies associated with offline examinations. By enabling seamless online exam management, Testcore minimizes the need for extensive physical infrastructure and staff involvement, allowing exams to be monitored remotely by a few individuals from anywhere in the world.&nbsp;

This system also empowers students to take exams from the comfort of their location, eliminating geographical barriers and significantly reducing costs. By leveraging widely available resources, Testcore achieves a streamlined, cost-effective solution that benefits both educators and students.

#  **Architecture Overview**

### **Database Design**

Testcore employs a hybrid database architecture, integrating both SQL and NoSQL databases to manage diverse data requirements efficiently:&nbsp;

1\. **SQL Database (PostgreSQL):**&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PostgreSQL is utilized to handle structured and relational data, ensuring robust and consistent storage for essential components like user information, exam results, and transactional records.

2\. **NoSQL Database (MongoDB):**&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MongoDB is leveraged to manage unstructured or semi-structured data, such as dynamic timetables and exam configurations. Its flexibility allows for seamless adaptation to varying data formats, ensuring scalability and performance for real-time operations.

This dual-database architecture optimally combines the strengths of SQL and NoSQL, catering to the unique demands of structured and unstructured data while maintaining scalability and reliability.

### **Folder Structure**

**The Testcore project is organized into two primary folders: client and server.**  

#### \- Client: This folder contains the frontend code, handling user interactions and the presentation layer. It is built to provide an intuitive and responsive interface for administrators, examiners, and students.&nbsp;&nbsp;

#### \- Server: This folder houses the backend code, which manages the application's business logic, database operations, and API endpoints.&nbsp;&nbsp;

#### Both the client and server components are independent and can be deployed on separate servers, offering flexibility and scalability.

&nbsp;

###  **Backend Design**

The backend of Testcore is architected as a microservices-based system, enabling modularity and load distribution. The services within the \`services\` folder are decoupled and can be deployed on separate servers. This design ensures:&nbsp;&nbsp;

1\. Scalability: Each service can be scaled independently based on demand, making it easier to handle increasing loads.&nbsp;&nbsp;

2\. Fault Tolerance: Failures in one service do not affect the functionality of others.&nbsp;&nbsp;

3\. Efficient Load Distribution: By distributing services across multiple servers, the overall performance is enhanced, reducing bottlenecks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### **Docker Integration**

The backend is fully containerized using Docker, making it portable and easy to deploy. A Dockerfile is included in the project, allowing the entire backend to be built into containers. This setup enables:&nbsp;&nbsp;

1\. Multiple Services on the Same Server: Using Docker, three different services (e.g., exam management, user authentication, and reporting) can run concurrently on the same server.&nbsp;&nbsp;

2\. Nginx Configuration: The services are reverse-proxied through Nginx, which efficiently routes requests to the appropriate services. This also supports features like WebSocket connections for real-time updates, load balancing, and caching.&nbsp;&nbsp;

3\. Simplified Deployment: Docker ensures that the backend environment is consistent across all deployments, reducing compatibility issues and setup time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### **Features of Testcore**

1) Chat System&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Testcore offers a robust chat system that enables users to interact in groups, facilitating quick resolution of exam-related doubts. Chat rooms are uniquely registered using the institution's name followed by the class name, ensuring a structured communication flow. These chat rooms are automatically locked during ongoing exams to prevent unauthorized communication and ensure exam integrity.

2) Video Call and Streaming&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The platform supports both one-to-many (M:1) and many-to-many (M:M) video calling systems. Examiners can monitor all students simultaneously using a centralized dashboard. This feature is specifically designed for live exam monitoring, allowing invigilators to ensure compliance with examination guidelines from any location.

3) SMS Notification System&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Testcore sends automated SMS notifications to students, providing timely updates about exams, including schedules, subjects, and courses they are registered for. This ensures students are always informed and prepared, minimizing communication gaps.

4) Anti-Virus Scanner&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain a secure environment, Testcore includes a file upload scanner. This feature automatically scans any file uploaded to the server, detecting and preventing the spread of malware or viruses. This ensures the integrity and safety of the system.

5) System Monitoring, Logging, and Testing&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Testcore integrates comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities. It maintains detailed logs of all system activities, enabling efficient debugging and performance tracking. The platform is compatible with tools like Grafana and Prometheus for advanced monitoring and alerting, ensuring system reliability and proactive issue resolution.

&nbsp;

**Summary**  

Testcore combines a microservices backend, dual-database architecture, and containerized deployment to deliver a robust, scalable, and efficient solution for online exam management. Its modular design and Docker integration provide the flexibility to run and manage services on different servers or as part of a unified setup, meeting diverse operational requirements with ease.
